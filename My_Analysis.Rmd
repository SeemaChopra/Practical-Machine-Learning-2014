Practical Machine Learning Course Project
========================================================


Objective:  A group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise using Classe varaible. 

Data: 
The training data for this project are available here:

The test data are available here:

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

First we have to install few packages mention below:

```{r}
library(caret)
library(knitr)
library(markdown)
library(e1071)
```

Then we need to read the data and remove the NA values and missing data. We have filter the data also for unwanted columns which will not help for prediction. Those are: "X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", 
              "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_window"

```{r}
#Read the training and testing file
data=read.csv("C:/2014/Coursera/Practical ML/pml-training.csv")
data1=read.csv("C:/2014/Coursera/Practical ML/pml-testing (2).csv")
## remove missing values
tmp <- data[, which(as.numeric(colSums(is.na(data))) < 5000)]
nz<-nearZeroVar(tmp)
newdata<-tmp[,-nz]
# Remove the columns that aren't the predictor variables
newdata1<-newdata[8:59]
```
Now I am trying to partition the training data into train and test set because of two reasons. One for cross validation and second it will help to reduce the rows to increase the computation.

```{r}
## partition of data
intrain<-createDataPartition(y=newdata1$classe,p=0.5,list=FALSE)
training<-newdata1[intrain,]
testing<-newdata1[-intrain,]
```
Now we are reday to devolp the model on training data and then we will test our model on testing data set. I have tried different model like PCA, KNN and Randomforest. But I found best results from Randomforest.Parameters will be tuned via 5-fold cross validation.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
cvCtrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, allowParallel = TRUE, verboseIter = TRUE)
modelfit <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = cvCtrl)

#testing it on testing data
pred<-predict(modelfit,testing)
table(testing$classe,pred)
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
varImpPlot(modelfit$finalModel)
```
